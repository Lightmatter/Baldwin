          <h2>Presenter</h2>
          <p class='promise-text'>PowerPoint slides have become the center of gravity in presentations today. Not the presenter. Everywhere you look, the tool that promised to make presentations exponentially better, is facilitating just the opposite: turning slides into dense pages that belong in an appendix, and creating a global competition to see just how much information can be crammed onto a single slide. Is it surprising that audiences are frustrated with presentations that are incomprehensible or incoherent?</p>
          <p class='promise-text'>This program is dedicated to reversing the trend, and putting the focus -- and the power -- of every presentation back where it belongs: with the presenter. It is a rediscovery of how logic, imagery, story, choreography and transition can transform ineffective presentations into ones that clarify thinking, catalyze buy-in, improve the quality of decision-making, and have the power to close deals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 text-holder" id='corporate-text'>
          <h2>Brand</h2>
          <p class='promise-text'>Advertising agencies overcomplicate it. Branding agencies would have you believe it is a Dark Art, better left to the experts. But the truth is that the creation and stewardship of a brand is not a mystery at all - it merely requires common sense, discipline, and consistency on the part of everyone and everything involved. Disney, Apple, Nike and IBM are just a few examples of world-class brands that understand that the creation of a brand begins with a distinct point-of-view; a crystal clear understanding of what you stand for and what your mission is in the world. Helping companies decipher their true identity and mission, and untangling overcomplicated branding and naming strategies is what this process is designed to do. An unconventional discovery process led by someone who has spent 30+ years in successful branding and communication management.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 text-holder" id='personal-text'>
          <h2>You</h2>
          <p class='promise-text'>You don’t have to be in the advertising business to know about brands and branding. Simply put, a brand is a promise. But what is a personal brand? And why is it important to cultivate yours? A personal brand is your promise of what people can expect from you. Cultivating that brand means you control how you are perceived, in terms of what you do, say, write, wear, how you behave and interact. Those who take personal personal branding seriously - from Steve Jobs to Lady Gaga - know the value of being perceived as unique, and the importance of consistently demonstrating those qualities that differentiate you. Through a series of one-on-one sessions, this process distills what defines you, and ensures that every point of contact and communication with the world consistently reinforces your unique personal brand.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 text-holder" id='one-on-one-text'>
          <h2>Performer</h2>
          <p class='promise-text'>Outside of the annual review process - from VP to CEO, few people take the time to evaluate themselves and the caliber of their performance. More and more promotions seem to come with little or no instruction; executives are just expected to know how to operate at a higher level. Combined, these two phenomena are largely responsible for a shrinking population of truly visionary leaders, performing at their peak. Successful leadership is about confidence, charisma, curiosity, and vision…and that’s where this program begins: understanding what those critical characteristics really mean, and where you are in your deployment of each. Having spent 30 years in global leadership, and consulting for global CEOs in Fortune 50 companies, there is nothing hypothetical about this approach - it closes the gap between where you are and where you want to be.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 text-holder" id='team-text'>
          <h2>Team</h2>
          <p class='promise-text'>Teams operate at sub-optimum levels due to lack of clarity. How can any team operate at peak performance if it isn’t clear who is supposed to do what? Or if the core mission, team goals, operating principles are unclear? They can’t. I provide Fortune 50 teams with a new approach to role definition, communication, interaction, and a simple, effective strategy for meetings and decision-making. Clarity is the operative word. As a leader of complex, global teams, I have developed a unique methodology: over the course of one to three days I take a team through a series of interactive, highly visual learning exercises, that force interaction, eliminate confusion, and provide long-term models for success. The goal is to optimize team performance and create a working environment that every member wants to join.</p>
